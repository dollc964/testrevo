    <h1>How To Make Yakisoba</h1>
    <img src="Yakisoba-5428-III.jpg.webp">
    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>
    Many of you know “soba” means buckwheat noodles, and that’s correct. However, the word soba in Japanese can also be used to describe noodles of any type. Yakisoba noodles are called Mushi Chukamen (蒸し中華麺 or Steamed Chinese-style noodles). They are made of wheat flour, kansui, and water. Even though the color of noodles is yellowish, they are not egg noodles, and the color is the result of using kansui. Yakisoba noodles are steamed and packaged, so they’re ready for a quick reheat. The texture of these noodles is similar to ramen noodles.

      <li>Transfer the yakisoba noodles to a sieve and quickly run hot water over the noodles. Loosen the noodles with your hands. Add the noodles to the skillet or wok and lower the heat to medium. It’s best to use tongs to combine the noodles and ingredients. Keep an eye on the noodles as they may stick to the skillet/wok.</li>
